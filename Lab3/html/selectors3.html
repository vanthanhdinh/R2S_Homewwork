            <p>In this article, we will know the <a href="#">HTML Paragraph</a><br>
            its basic implementation through the examples.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we dont use the closing tag but this may raise unexpected results.
            So, it is a good convention, and we must use the closing tag.</p>
        <p>Key Points: When we look at the webpage, we see that there are few spaces added before
            and after a paragraph. HTML does this by default.</p>
