        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>In this article, we will know the <span class="alert">HTML Paragraph</span>, & <span class="alert start">its basic implementation</span> through the examples.</p>
        <h2 id="head2">A level 2 heading</h2>
        <p>Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we dont use the closing tag but this may raise unexpected results.
            So, it is a good convention, and we must use the closing tag.</p>
        <h2>Another level 2 heading</h2>
        <p><span class="alert go">Key Points:</span> When we look at the webpage, we see that there are few spaces added before and after a paragraph. HTML
            does this by default.</p>
